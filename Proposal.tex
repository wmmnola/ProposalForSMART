\section{Introduction}
Spreadsheets are an archaic and slow organization method. While useful for small amounts of data, once we introduce large amounts of data, it
becomes a mess. Such is the situation we are presently faced with the SMART club scheduling system. The spreadsheets which manage it, are no
longer convenient. We run a spreadsheet script, which no one understands anymore, and it constantly breaks down. The hope of this proposal is to 
streamline the process, to dump spreadsheets once and for all. 

The answer is simple. Create a Database. A database would allow for easy manipulation of large amounts of data, and can be coupled with a easy
to use user-interface. This strategy also scales well. Databases have no "limit," so long as we gear the software so there is no hard limit. This will be incredibly important in the next few years, as the school attempts to expand it's infrastructure to accommodate more students. The current technology \emph{does not scale.}

The detraction is the start up cost. To migrate the current system will take considerable work; however, it is not enough to warrant continuing
to run off of spreadsheets.
