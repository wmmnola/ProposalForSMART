\section{Introduction}
Spreadsheets are an archaic and slow organization method. While useful for small amounts of data, once we introduce large amounts of data, it
becomes a mess. Such is the situation we are presently faced with the SMART club scheduling system. The spreadsheets which manage it, are no
longer convenient. We run a spreadsheet script, which no one understands anymore, and it constantly breaks down. The hope of this proposal is to 
streamline the process, to dump spreadsheets once and for all. 

The answer is simple. Create a Database. A database would allow for easy manipulation of large amounts of data, and can be coupled with a easy
to use user-interface.
